## Technical Approach

This project follows a modular full-stack architecture, leveraging modern web technologies and AI-powered insights for habit tracking and wellness prediction.

### 1. Frontend (React + Vite + Chakra UI + Redux Toolkit)
üìç *React* for UI components and user interaction. <br>
üìç *Vite* for fast development and build performance. <br>
üìç *Chakra UI* for a consistent, accessible UI. <br>
üìç *Redux Toolkit* for efficient state management (user data, logs, and health scores). <br>

### 2. Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)
üìç *Express* for RESTful API endpoints. <br>
üìç *MongoDB* for storing user data and logs. <br>
üìç *JWT Authentication* for secure login and session management. <br>

### 3. AI & Scoring Engine with Data Visualization
üìç *Health Score* based on sleep, water intake, meals, workouts, and consistency. <br>
üìç *Prediction* using moving averages and linear regression for future health trends. <br>
üìç *Charts* to display habits and predicted health trends using libraries like Recharts. <br>
üìç *Consistency streaks* and health milestones visually tracked. <br>

This architecture enables a responsive, data-driven web app focused on tracking and improving user health through simple UI and AI insights.

## AI Logic Description

This section explains the core logic behind how the application calculates health scores and provides personalized recommendations.

### Overview

The AI component evaluates user habit data (sleep, hydration, meals, exercise) to compute a *health score* and deliver *tailored suggestions*. This helps users make data-driven lifestyle changes by monitoring patterns and offering actionable advice.


### Health Score Calculation Logic

The score is computed from five key areas:

| *Component*         | *Description* |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| *Sleep Score*       | Based on average hours vs. user goal. Under-sleeping penalized more than over-sleeping. |
| *Water Intake Score*| Calculated relative to weight-adjusted hydration targets (based on 70kg reference). |
| *Nutrition Score*   | Evaluates healthy meals ratio and consistency in meal timing. |
| *Exercise Score*    | Assesses duration and intensity of workouts relative to goals. |
| *Consistency Bonus* | Rewards daily habit streaks up to 50 bonus points. |

#### Final Score Computation

- *Weightage*:
  - Sleep: 30%
  - Water: 20%
  - Nutrition: 25%
  - Exercise: 25%
- *Bonus*: Consistency adds up to 50 extra points.
- *Range*: Final score is normalized to a 0‚Äì100+ range.

### AI Recommendation Engine

When a category score drops below 80 or the streak is under 3 days, the engine provides *personalized tips* using:

- *Deficit analysis*
- *Behavioral trends*
- *Priority tagging*

#### Focus Areas

| *Area*     | *Suggestions*                                |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Sleep        | Improve bedtime routines and maintain consistency. |
| Water        | Encourage daily hydration based on intake percentage. |
| Nutrition    | Promote healthy balanced meals and consistent timing.     |
| Exercise     | Optimize both duration and intensity of sessions. |
| Consistency  | Encourage daily logging and building streaks.     |

### Unique AI Features

| *Feature*                       | *Details*                                                   |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Adaptive Scoring                  | Dynamic adjustment based on overshooting or undershooting goals. |
| Streak Bonus                      | Rewards consistent tracking behavior.                         |
| Intensity-Based Workout Scoring   | Encourages effort, not just time spent.                       |

##  Future Improvements

- Machine learning-based anomaly detection (e.g., sleep disruption patterns).
- Integration with wearable device data (Apple Health, Fitbit, etc.).
- Time-series prediction of future health scores using habit trends.
